## Description
This work is part of a larger class project for NorthWestern Data Science Bootcamp. Everything in this repository represents my work on the project. My role on the project included analyzes relationships between socioeconomic influoences of Chicago neighborhood crime. Specifically, I investigated economic, health, and birth factors on the Chicago homicide rate (per 100,0000 individuals; age-adjusted). There are 77 Chicago neighborhoods. Data was gathered from the Chicago Data Portal.

I performed several multiple regression analysis on economic, health, and birth influences on neighborhood homicide. I repeated these analyses on the homicide rate in log units. The homicide rate was transformed into log units to fit a normal distribution.
